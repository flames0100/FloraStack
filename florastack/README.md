# FloraStack Frontend (Mixed theme)

This is a ready-to-deploy Next.js (App Router) frontend for FloraStack with a mixed light/dark design.

How to deploy (iPad-friendly):
1. Create a new GitHub repo (e.g., FloraStack).
2. In the repo, click Add file â†’ Upload files and upload the contents of this ZIP (select all files in the Files app).
3. Commit; then import the repo into Vercel and deploy. Vercel will detect Next.js automatically.
4. Optionally, run locally: `npm install` then `npm run dev`.
